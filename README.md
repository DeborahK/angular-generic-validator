# angular-generic-validator
Defines a generic validator for Angular 2 Reactive Forms

The generic validator resides in shared/generic-validator.ts.
The customer component is provided as an example usage of the generic validator.

*NOTE* This validator does not handle blur events and therefore cannot display required validation messages when the user enters and leaves an input element.
